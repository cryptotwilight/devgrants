# Project Description

The purpose of this project will be to research the key impediments to the adoption of decentralized online data storage on the Filecoin network. With the increase in data management regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or the impending regulation of cryptoasset businesses(https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/cryptoassets), the Filecoin Community of innovators is handicapped by a lack of clarity as to the "real" adoption challenges that potential user groups and commercial partners face. In short, the strong technical advances of the Filecoin community need to be complimented and eventually driven by an equivalent business understanding. This pair can then propel mainstream adoption of the Filecoin decentralized storage model. 

Our research will aim to sensitise the Filecoin community to the current corporate and enterprise pressures facing potential Filecoin adopters. The goal will be to create a sound evaluated business understanding that enables better Filecoin infrastructure and services to be innovated with an intrinsic high quality user experience. As part of our research, we will conduct a corporate, governmental and third sector outreach covering organisations based in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Our objective is to take a broad view across a variety of industries and sectors so as to build a qualitative understanding of data storage priorities and behaviours. We will look to produce a comprehensive summary publication of the key Filecoin adoption issues for consumption by the Filecoin community.

# Additional Information

Our motivation for this project stems from our collective introduction to Filecoin as part of the Encode Labs Spark Hackathon 2020. Our initial user research conducted to help us in our endeavour on the hackathon highlighted a gap. This is the gap that we would like to fill with this project contribution.
